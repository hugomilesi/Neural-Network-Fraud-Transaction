# Neural-Network-Fraud-Transaction

# <u>Project Overview</u>

E-commerce Fraud Transaction Analysis involves dissecting fraudulent transaction patterns to develop robust detection strategies. It scrutinizes transactional data, including amounts, frequencies, and user behavior, aiming to uncover anomalies indicative of fraud. Leveraging machine learning and statistical modeling, the project seeks to empower businesses with effective fraud detection mechanisms. By analyzing data features and employing advanced algorithms, it aims to enhance security measures, protect financial assets, and preserve customer trust. Ultimately, the project strives to provide actionable insights to combat the evolving landscape of online fraud in e-commerce ecosystems.

In this repository, I will leverage an E-commerce Fraud Transactions dataset to conduct a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), aiming to unveil critical patterns and trends within our data. Subsequently, I will preprocess the data and develop a neural network model specifically tailored to detect fraudulent transactions within the e-commerce platform. By harnessing the power of neural networks, this project endeavors to provide businesses with an advanced and efficient tool for identifying and mitigating fraudulent activities, thereby bolstering the security and integrity of financial transactions in the e-commerce domain.

# <u>The Data</u>

The data is sourced from Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shriyashjagtap/fraudulent-e-commerce-transactions). The dataset contains 1472952 entries representing 1472952 unique customers. The features are numeric and categorical in nature, so i will need to address these differences before modeling.
